*                     SYMPHONY MATCH Application                             * 
******************************************************************************

The SYMPHONY MATCH application solves the standard matching problem. This
application is intended as an illustration of how to develop an application
with SYMPHONY. For a more detailed walkthrough of the development of this
solver, please see SYMPHONY-5.0/Doc/Walkthrough.pdf. See below for usage.

******************************************************************************
*              COMPILING THE SYMPHONY MATCH APPLICATION (Unix)               *
******************************************************************************

This version of the SYMPHONY MATCH application is intended to work with
SYMPHONY-5.0. First, configure and compile SYMPHONY 5.0 as described in
SYMPHONY-5.0/README-5.0.  Download and unpack the source code for the MATCH
application from the file SYMPHONY-MATCH-5.0.tgz. Modify the variables in the
MATCH-5.0/Makefile appropriately. In particular, you must set the path to 
SYMPHONY itself. If the application is unpacked as a subdirectory of 
SYMPHONY-5.0 subdirectory, no further modification should be necessary. 
Typing "make" in the MATCH subdirectory should successfully make the 
executable "match". It will be installed in the directory 
MATCH-5.0/bin.$(ARCH)/$(LP_SOLVER). Otherwise, you must also set the path to 
the application's files. See usage below.

******************************************************************************
*            COMPILING THE SYMPHONY MATCH APPLICATION (Windows)              *
******************************************************************************

This version of the SYMPHONY MATCH application is intended to work with
SYMPHONY-5.0. Here is a sketch outline of how to compile the SYMPHONY MATCH
application in Microsoft Windows. Direct support is provided for compilation
under MS Visual Studio 6.0. Compilation for other compilers should also be
possible. Note that the Windows version has some limitations. Detailed timing
information is not currently provided. Support is only provided for running
in sequential mode at this time.

First, download SYMPHONY-5.0.zip and unzip the archive. This will create a
subdirectory called SYMPHONY-5.0 containing all the source files. Download 
and unpack SYMPHONY-MATCH-5.0.zip. 

There are two options. You can either compile on the command-line, using
the MSVC++ makefile, MATCH-5.0\WIN32\match.mak, or you can use the 
provided projects and workspaces. However for the second option, it is 
important the MATCH archive be unpacked in the SYMPHONY-5.0 subdirectory 
or the project files will not work. Compiling on the command-line is somewhat 
easier since it requires only editing the makefile and typing a single command.

******************** Using the NMAKE Utility *********************************

1. Edit the MATCH-5.0\WIN32\match.mak makefile to reflect your environment. 
This involves specifying the LP solver to be used, assigning some 
variables and setting various paths. Only minor edits should be required. 
An explanation of what has to be set is contained in the comments in the 
makefile.

2. To use many of the new capabilities of SYMPHONY, you must have installed
the COIN libraries, available from www.coin-or.org. By default, SYMPHONY is 
set to use COIN LP solver, CLP, COIN Open Solver Interface, OSI and
COIN Cut Generation Library, CGL. To keep this configuration, you should 
install OSI, CGL, CLP and the Coin utilities (under COIN\Coin). The path to 
the COIN libraries must be specified in the makefile.

3. If you wish to read GMPL/AMPL files, you will have to install the Gnu
Linear Programming Kit (GLPK), which contains a parser for GMPL/AMPL
files. The path to the GLPK libraries must be specified in the makefile.

4. Once configuration is done, type "nmake /f match.mak" in the 
MATCH-5.0\WIN32 directory. The executable "match.exe" will be created under 
the MATCH-5.0\WIN32\Debug directory.

5. To test the executable, type "match.exe -F ..\..\sample.mat" at a command
prompt from the MATCH-5.0\WIN32\Debug directory.

******************** Using the MSVC++ Workspace ******************************

1. In MS Visual C++ 6.0, open the workspace 
SYMPHONY-5.0\MATCH-5.0\WIN32\match.dsw.
Note that there are two projects, one called "match" and the other called 
"symphonyLib". The "symphonyLib" project compiles the source code with the 
calls to the user-defined callbacks used to customize the solver to create the 
callable library: "symphonyLib.lib". The "match" project compiles those 
user callbacks together with the main function, links them with the callable 
library and creates the executable: "match.exe".

2. To use many of the new capabilities of SYMPHONY, you must have installed
the COIN libraries. Specifically, you should install OSI, CGL, CLP and the Coin
utilities (in the COIN/Coin directory). These can be downloaded from 
www.coin-or.org. The default location for COIN is C:\COIN\.

3. By default, SYMPHONY is set to use the OSI CLP interface. To see this
check the following settings:

-- "__OSI_CLP__" is defined in the preprocessor definitions of both
"symphonyLib" and "match" projects (right-click on one of the projects, and 
then choose Settings --> C/C++ --> Preprocessor in the category drop-down 
menu).

-- Paths to the include files of COIN utilities (Coin), OSI, OSI CLP, and
CLP are specified in the same settings window as for the preprocessor
definitions. Note that, the Coin, OSI, OSI_CLP and CLP include directories are
assumed to be in C:\COIN\Coin, C:\COIN\Osi, C:\COIN\Osi\OsiClp and
C:\COIN\Clp directories, respectively. If they are not,
make sure that you have set the correct paths in both projects before
compiling.

-- The "match" project is dependent on the "symphony" project (see the
dependencies in Project --> Dependencies) and it includes the necessary
libraries: "symphonyLib", "coinLib", "osiLib", "osiClpLib", and "clpLib" 
(solver library).

If you want to use another solver:

-- If you want to use the solver again through the OSI interface, change the 
preprocessor definition in both projects from "__OSI_CLP__" to "__OSI_XXX__", 
where "XXX" is replaced by the desired solver's acronym ("__OSI_CPLEX__", 
"__OSI_GLPK__", "__OSI_OSL__", etc.). Otherwise, change it to either  
"__CPLEX__" or "__OSL__" in both projects since SYMPHONY is able to use 
CPLEX and OSL solvers directly.

-- Change the path definitions of the include files: for instance, if you want
to use "__OSI_CPLEX__", define C:\COIN\Osi\OsiCpx and 
"C:\ILOG\cplex81\include\ilcplex" (assuming CPLEX is installed here) as the 
solver's include files path definitions or if you want to use "__OSI_OSL__", 
define C:\COIN\Osi\OsiOsl and C:\ProgramFiles\IbmOslV3Lib\osllib (assuming 
OSL is installed here) instead of the OSI CLP and CLP path definitions.
If you want to use the native CPLX or OSL interface directly, delete all the 
path definitions (you are not required to have COIN and OSI), and just add the
path definitions for the CPLEX or OSL include files.

-- Add the appropriate libraries to the "match" project. For instance, if
you want to use "__OSI_OSL__", then add the "osiOslLib" and "oslmd6030" 
(OSL solver library) files after deleting "osiClpLib" and "clpLib" 
dependencies from the project. If you want to use the native OSL interface, 
then delete all the libraries (except the "symphonyLib") and just add the 
"oslmd6030" library for it is the unique solver library we need now.

4. By default, SYMPHONY is also set to use the COIN CGL library for
generating cuts. To use CGL, the "symphonyLib" project has the "ADD_CGL_CUTS"
preprocessor definition and the path to C:\COIN\Cgl\ (be sure that this path
directs SYMPHONY to the include directory of CGL). If you also don't want to 
use the CGL library, simply delete the "ADD_CGL_CUTS" preprocessor definition, 
the path definition for the CGL include files and the "cglLib" library from 
the "match" project.

5. DO NOT CHANGE COMPILER DEFINES NOT RELATED TO THE LP SOLVER. Important note
for OSL users: when using OSL in Windows, you must also add "OSLMSDLL" to the
list of definitions.

6. Note that there are a number of additional preprocessor definitions that
control the functionality of SYMPHONY. These definitions are described in
SYMPHONY-5.0/Makefile, a Unix-style makefile included with the
distribution. To enable the functionality associated with a particular
definition, simply add it to the list of definitions, as above.

7. You must also be sure to have any .dll files required for your LP solver to
be in your search path. Either move the required .dll to the directory
containing "match.exe" or add the path to the "PATH" Windows environment
variable.

8. Once you have the proper settings for your LP solver, choose "Build
match.exe" from the Build menu. This should successfully build the
executable.

9. To test the executable, right click on the "match" project, go to the
"Debug" tab and set the program arguments to "-F ..\sample.mat" Note that
command-line switches are Unix-style.

10. Now choose "Execute" from the build menu and the solver should solve the
sample problem.

Note that there is some functionality missing from the Windows version. Most
prominently, the timing functions do not work. This functionality should be
easy to add -- let me know if you are interested in doing it and I will give
you all the help I can. In addition, the Windows version will only run in
sequential mode for a variety of reasons. However, it should be relatively
easy to get it running in parallel if you can get PVM working under
Windows. Let me know if you are interested.

*                      USING THE SOLVER                                       *
*******************************************************************************

Using the matching problem (MATCH), we try to pair the nodes(persons,jobs,etc)
with minimum cost. By pairing, we mean that each node is matched with exactly
one other node in return for a cost. The data file consists of a symmetric,
square matrix with rows and columns both representing the nodes and with the
cost entities of pairing the corresponding rows and columns. Note that the
diagonal of this matrix should be zero.

To execute the MATCH application, just specify the location of the data file
by typing "-F 'filename'" as an argument after the executable name. There is a
sample file called sample.mat that you can try to make sure the solver is
working. More data files may become available. Please check
http://www.branchandcut.org/MATCH/ for more information. The other user
defined parameters are the following:

		-H: help (user switches)
		-F file: problem instance data is in 'file'

You can also obtain the above list by tying the executable name followed by
"-H". There are a number of other (for now) undocumented parameters that can
be used to fine-tune the performance of the solver. These must be set in a
parameter file. The SYMPHONY User's Manual explains the use of the parameter
file.

Some of SYMPHONY's native parameters can also be set on the command
line. Below is a list of these parameters. This list can also be obtained by
typing the executable name with no command-line arguments. Note that all
SYMPHONY parameters are denoted by a lowercase letter. Note that there are
dozens of other parameters that can be set with the use of a parameter
file. These parameters are listed in the SYMPHONY User's Manual.

		-h: help
        	-a: no cut timeout
        	-d: enable graph drawing
        	-g: use cut generator
