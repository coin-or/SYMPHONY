Maintaining and Scanning the Pool</A>

<P>
The cut manager's primary job is to receive a solution from an
NP module and return cuts from the pool that are violated by it. The
cuts are stored along with two pieces of information--the level of
the tree on which the cut was generated, known simply as the <EM>level</EM> of the cut, and the number of times it has been checked for
violation since the last time it was actually found to be violated,
known as the number of <EM>touches</EM>. The number of touches
can be used as a simplistic measure of its effectiveness. Since the pool
can get quite large, the user can choose to scan only cuts whose
number of touches is below a specified threshold and/or cuts that were
generated on a level at or above the current one in the tree. The idea
behind this second criterion is to try to avoid checking cuts that were
not generated ``nearby'' in the tree, as they are less likely to be
effective. Any cut generated at a level in the tree
below the level of the current node must have been generated in a
different part of the tree. Although this is admittedly a naive
method, it does seem to work reasonably well.

<P>
On the other hand, the user may define a specific measure of quality for
each cut to be used instead. For example, the degree of
violation is an obvious candidate. This measure of quality must be
computed by the user, since the cut pool module has no knowledge of
the cut data structures. The quality is recomputed every time
the user checks the cut for violation and a running average is used as
the global quality measure. The cuts in the pool are periodically
sorted by this measure and only the highest quality cuts
are checked each time. All duplicate cuts, as well as all cuts whose
number of touches exceeds or whose quality falls below specified
thresholds, are periodically purged from the pool to keep it as small as
possible.
