Checking the Validity of Cuts and Tracing the Optimal Path
</H2>

<P>
Sometimes the only evidence of a bug is the fact that the optimal solution to
a particular problem is never found. This is usually caused by either (1)
adding an invalid cut, or (2) performing an invalid branching. There are two
options available for discovering such errors. The first is for checking the
validity of added cuts. This checking must, of course, be done by the user,
but SYMPHONY can facilitate such checking. To do this, the user must fill in the
function <A HREF="node260.html#user_check_validity_of_cut"><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">user_check_validity_of_cut()</SPAN></A>. THIS function is called every time a cut is
passed from the cut generator to the LP and can function as an independent
verifier. To do this, the user must pass (through her own data structures) a
known feasible solution. Then for each cut passed into the function, the user
can check whether the cut is satisfied by the feasible solution. If not, then
there is a problem! Of course, the problem could also be with the checking
routine. To enable this functionality, the user must configure SYMPHONY with
the flag 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;enable-cut-check</SPAN></FONT> (see Section <A HREF="node13.html#building_from_source">2.2</A>). 

<P>
Tracing the optimal path can alert the user when the subproblem which admits a
particular known feasible solution (at least according to the branching
restrictions that have been imposed so far) is pruned. This could be due to an
invalid branching. Note that this option currently only works for branching on
binary variables. To use this facility, the user must fill in the function
<A HREF="node223.html#user_send_feas_sol"><SPAN style="font-family:monospace">user_send_feas_sol()</SPAN></A>. All that is required is to pass out an array
of user indices that are in the feasible solution that you want to trace. Each
time the subproblem which admits this feasible solution is branched on, the
branch that continues to admit the solution is marked. When one of these
marked subproblems is pruned, the user is notified. To enable this
functionality, the user must configure SYMPHONY with the flag

<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;enable-trace-path</SPAN></FONT> (see Section <A HREF="node13.html#building_from_source">2.2</A>).
