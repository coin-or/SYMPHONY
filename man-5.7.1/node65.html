Variables
</H3>

<P>
In SYMPHONY, problem variables are <EM>represented</EM> by a unique global
index assigned to each variable by the user. This index represents
each variable's position in a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; global list known only to
the user. The main requirement of this indexing scheme is that, given
an index and a list of active cuts, the user must be able to generate
the corresponding column to be added to the matrix. As an example, in
problems where the variables correspond to the edges of an underlying
graph, the index could be derived from a lexicographic ordering of the
edges (when viewed as ordered pairs of nodes).

<P>
This indexing scheme provides a very compact representation, as well
as a simple and effective means of moving variables in and out of the
active set. However, it means that the user must have a priori
knowledge of all problem variables and a method for indexing them. For
combinatorial models such as the <EM>Traveling Salesman Problem</EM>,
this does not present a problem. However, for some set partitioning
models, for instance, the number of columns may not be known in
advance. Even if the number of columns is known in advance, a viable
indexing scheme may not be evident. Eliminating the indexing
requirement by allowing variables to have abstract, user-defined
representations (such as we do for cuts), would allow for more
generality, but would also sacrifice some efficiency. A hybrid scheme,
allowing the user to have both indexed and <EM>algorithmic</EM> variables
(variables with user-defined representations) is planned for a future 
version of SYMPHONY.

<P>
For efficiency, the problem variables can be divided into two sets, the
<EM>base variables</EM> and the <EM>extra variables</EM>. The base variables
are active in all subproblems, whereas the extra variables can be
added and removed. There is no theoretical difference between
base variables and extra variables; however, designating a well-chosen
set of base variables can significantly increase efficiency. Because
they can move in and out of the problem, maintaining extra variables
requires additional bookkeeping and computation. If the user has
reason to believe a priori that a variable is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or has a high
probability of having a non-zero value in some optimal solution to the
problem, then that variable should be designated as a base variable.
It is up to the user to designate which variables should be active in
the root subproblem. Typically, when column generation is used, only base 
variables are active. Otherwise, all variables must be active in the 
root node.
