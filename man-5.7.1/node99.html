<P>
To develop an application with SYMPHONY, you need to first understand how the
source files are organized. Note that in this chapter, all path names are
given Unix-style. When you unpack the SYMPHONY source distribution, you will
notice at the root level a number of files associated with the automatic
configuration system, as well as a number of subdirectories, each of which
corresponds to a library used by SYMPHONY for some specific functionality. The
files associated with SYMPHONY itself are located in the 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">SYMPHONY</SPAN></FONT>
subdirectory. Within the SYMPHONY subdirectory are a number of other
subdirectories, including one called 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">src</SPAN></FONT> containing the source files
for SYMPHONY itself. 

<P>
Also in the main 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">SYMPHONY/</SPAN></FONT> subdirectory, there is a subdirectory called

<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Applications/</SPAN></FONT> (see Sections&nbsp;<A HREF="node28.html#build_appl_unix">2.2.2.4</A> and
<A HREF="node33.html#build_appl_msvc">2.2.3.4</A>) for instructions on building the applications). The

<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Applications/</SPAN></FONT> subdirectory contains the source code for a number of
sample applications developed with SYMPHONY, as well as function stubs for
developing a custom application using SYMPHONY's callbacks. The subdirectory

<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">SYMPHONY/Applications/USER</SPAN></FONT> contains the files needed for implementing
the callbacks and is a template for developing an application. In this
directory and its subdirectories, which mirror the subdirectories of SYMPHONY
itself, each file contains function stubs that can be filled in to create a
new custom application. There is a separate subdirectory for each
module&mdash;master (
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">Master/</SPAN></FONT>), tree management (
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">TreeManager/</SPAN></FONT>), cut
generation (
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">CutGen/</SPAN></FONT>), cut management (
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">CutPool/</SPAN></FONT>), and node
processing (
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">LP/</SPAN></FONT>). Within each subdirectory, there is a file, initially
called 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">USER/*/user_*.c</SPAN></FONT>, where 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">*</SPAN></FONT> is the name of the module. The
primary thing that you, as the user, need to understand to build a custom
application is how to fill in these stubs. That is what the second part of
this chapter is about. Before describing that, however, we will discuss how to
build your application.
