Distributed-memory architectures
</H4>

<P>
<A ID="PVM"></A>To compile a distributed application, it is necessary that PVM be installed
either in the system path or in the directory pointed to by the environment
variable 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">PVM_ROOT</SPAN></FONT> (this can be your home directory if PVM is not
already installed on your network). To install PVM yourself, the current
version can be obtained at <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">
<A ID="tex2html19"
  HREF="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/">http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/</A></SPAN>. It should compile and install without
problems on most architectures. You will have to make a few modifications to
your 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">.cshrc</SPAN></FONT> file, such as defining the 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">PVM_ROOT</SPAN></FONT> environment
variable, but this is all explained clearly in the PVM documentation. Note
that all executables (or at least a link to them) must reside in the

<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH</SPAN></FONT> directory in order for parallel processes
to be spawned correctly. The environment variable 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">PVM_ARCH</SPAN></FONT> is set in
your 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">.cshrc</SPAN></FONT> file and should contain a string representing the current
architecture type. To run a parallel application, you must first start up the
daemon on each of the machines you plan to use in the computation. How to do
this is also explained in the PVM documentation.

<P>
To configure for a parallel build with the default parallel configuration,
invoke the configuration script as follows:

<PRE>
 ./coinbrew fetch build SYMPHONY@\VER --with-pvm
</PRE> 
Note that there are a number of different parallel configurations (see
Chapter <A HREF="node68.html#SYMPHONY-modules">4.3.3</A> for an overview of SYMPHONY's parallel
modules). The default configuration is to build two parallel modules, the
first consisting of the master, tree management, and cut management modules,
while the second consisting of the node processing, and cut generation
modules. To build in another configuration, there are four configure flags
that control which modules run as separate executables and which are called
directly in serial fashion. The variables are as follows:
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;with-cg</SPAN></FONT>: If set, then the cut generator function will
        be called directly from the LP in serial fashion, instead of running
        as a separate executable. This is desirable if cut generation is quick
        and running it in parallel is not worth the price of the communication
        overhead.
        
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;with-cp</SPAN></FONT>: If set, then the cut pool(s) will be
        maintained as a data structure auxiliary to the tree manager.
        
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;with-lp</SPAN></FONT>: If set, then the LP functions will be called
        directly from the tree manager. When running the distributed version,
        this necessarily implies that there will only be one active subproblem
        at a time, and hence the code will essentially be running serially. In
        the shared-memory version, however, the tree manager will be threaded
        in order to execute subproblems in parallel.
        
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD>
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;with-tm</SPAN></FONT>: If set, then the tree will be managed
        directly from the master process. This is only recommended if a single
        executable is desired (i.e.&nbsp;the three other variables are also set to
        true). A single executable is extremely useful for debugging purposes.
</DD>
</DL>
These variables can be set in virtually any combination, though some
don't really make much sense. Note that in a few user functions that
involve process communication, there will be different versions for
serial and parallel computation. This is accomplished through the use
of 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">#ifdef</SPAN></FONT> statements in the source code. This is well documented
in the function descriptions and the in the source files containing
the function stubs.

<P>
Once configured, follow the build instructions in Section <A HREF="node11.html#building-unix">2.1.1</A>
to build the code. Note that this will also compile the sequential version.
Make sure there are links from your 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH</SPAN></FONT>
subdirectory to each of the executables in your 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">bin/</SPAN></FONT> directory, as
required by PVM. In order to keep track of the various possible
configurations, executable and their corresponding libraries are named as
follows. The name of each executable is 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">symphony</SPAN></FONT>, along with a
combination of the (abbreviated) names of the modules that were combined to
produce that executable joined by underscores: 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">m</SPAN></FONT> for the master module,

<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">tm</SPAN></FONT> for the tree management module, 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">lp</SPAN></FONT> for the node processing
module, 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">cg</SPAN></FONT> for the cut generation module, and 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">cp</SPAN></FONT> for the cut
management module. For instance, in the default distributed configuration, the
executables produced are 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">symphony_m_tm_cp</SPAN></FONT> and

<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">symphony_lp_cg</SPAN></FONT>.

<P>
To test the parallel version, first start the PVM daemon by typing 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">pvm</SPAN></FONT>
on the command line and then typing 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">quit</SPAN></FONT>. As above, invoke SYMPHONY
using the sample MPS file called 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">sample.mps</SPAN></FONT> included with the
distribution. To specify the file name, use the 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">-F</SPAN></FONT> command-line option,
i.e., in the root directory, type

<PRE>
 bin/symphony_m_EXT -F SYMPHONY/Datasets/sample.mps
</PRE> 

<P>
where 
<FONT COLOR="#a52a2a"><SPAN  CLASS="texttt">EXT</SPAN></FONT> is the extension to be added according to the chosen
configuration of the modules.
