Fault Tolerance
</H2> 

<P>
Fault tolerance is an important consideration for solving large problems on
computing networks whose nodes may fail unpredictably. The tree manager tracks
the status of all processes and can restart them as necessary. Since the state
of the entire tree is known at all times, the most that will be lost if an NP
module or cut generator is killed is the work that had been completed on that
particular search node. To protect against the tree manager itself or a cut
pool being killed, full logging capabilities have been implemented. If
desired, the tree manager can write out the entire state of the tree to disk
periodically, allowing a warm restart if a fault occurs. Similarly, the cut
pool process can be warm-started from a log file. This not only allows for
fault tolerance but also for full reconfiguration in the middle of solving a
long-running problem. Such reconfiguration could consist of anything from
adding more processors to moving the entire solution process to another
network.
