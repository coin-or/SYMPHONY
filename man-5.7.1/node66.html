Constraints
</H3>

<P>
Because the global list of potential constraints (also called cuts) is
not usually known a priori or is extremely large, constraints cannot
generally be represented simply by a user-assigned index. Instead,
each constraint is assigned a global index only after it becomes
active in some subproblem. It is up to the user, if desired, to
designate a compact <EM>representation</EM> for each class of constraints
that is to be generated and to implement subroutines for converting
from this compact representation to a matrix row, given the list of
active variables. For instance, suppose that the set of nonzero
variables in a particular class of constraints corresponds to the set
of edges across a cut in a graph. Instead of storing the indices of
each variable explicitly, one could simply store the set of nodes on
one side (&ldquo;shore&rdquo;) of the cut as a bit array. The constraint could
then be constructed easily for any particular set of active variables
(edges).

<P>
Just as with variables, the constraints are divided into <EM>core
constraints</EM> and <EM>extra constraints</EM>. The core constraints are
those that are active in every subproblem, whereas the extra
constraints can be generated dynamically and are free to enter and leave
as appropriate. Obviously, the set of core constraints must be known
and constructed explicitly by the user. Extra constraints, on the
other hand, are generated dynamically by the cut generator as they are
violated. As with variables, a good set of core constraints can have a
significant effect on efficiency.

<P>
Note that the user is not <EM>required</EM> to designate a compact
representation scheme. Constraints can simply be represented
explicitly as matrix rows with respect to the global set of variables.
However, designating a compact form can result in large reductions in
memory use if the number of variables in the problem is large.
