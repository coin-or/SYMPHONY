Managing the LP Relaxation
</H3>

<P>
The majority of the computational effort of BCP is spent
solving LPs and hence a major emphasis in the development was to make
this process as efficient as possible. Besides using a good LP engine,
the primary way in which this is done is by controlling the size of
each relaxation, both in terms of number of active variables and
number of active constraints. 

<P>
The number of constraints is controlled through use of a local
pool and through purging of ineffective constraints. When a cut is
generated by the cut generator, it is first sent to the local cut
pool. In each iteration, up to a specified number of the strongest
cuts (measured by degree of violation) from the local pool are added
to the problem. Cuts that are not strong enough to be added to the
relaxation are eventually purged from the list. In addition, cuts are
purged from the LP itself when they have been deemed ineffective for
more than a specified number of iterations, where ineffective is
defined as either (1) the corresponding slack variable is positive,
(2) the corresponding slack variable is basic, or (3) the dual value
corresponding to the row is zero (or very small). Cuts that have
remained effective in the LP for a specified number of iterations are
sent to the global pool where they can be used in later search nodes.
Cuts that have been purged from the LP can be made active again if
they later become violated.

<P>
The number of variables (columns) in the relaxation is controlled
through <EM>reduced cost fixing</EM> and <EM>dynamic column generation</EM>.
Periodically, each active variable is <EM>priced</EM> to see if it can be
fixed by reduced cost. That is, the LP reduced cost is examined in an
effort  to determine whether fixing that variable at
one of its bounds would remove improving solutions; if not, the
variable is fixed and removed from consideration. If the matrix is
<EM>full</EM> at the time of the fixing, meaning that all unfixed
variables are active, then the fixing is permanent for that subtree.
Otherwise, it is temporary and only remains in force until the next
time that columns are dynamically generated.

<P>
Because SYMPHONY was originally designed for combinatorial problems
with relatively small numbers of variables, techniques for performing
dynamic column generation are somewhat unrefined. Currently, variables
are priced out sequentially by index, which can be costly. To improve
the process of pricing variables, we plan to increase the symmetry
between our methods for handling variables and those for handling
cuts. This includes (1) allowing user-defined, abstract
representations for variables, (2) allowing the use of &ldquo;variable
generators&rdquo; analogous to cut generators, (3) implementing both global
and local pools for variables, (4) implementing heuristics that help
determine the order in which the indexed variables should be priced,
and (5) allowing for methods of simultaneously pricing out large
groups of variables. Much of this is already implemented in COIN/BCP.

<P>
Because pricing is computationally burdensome, it currently takes
place only either (1) before branching (optional), or (2) when a node
is about to be pruned (depending on the phase&mdash;see the description of
the two-phase algorithm in Sect. <A HREF="node89.html#two-phase">4.4.3.3</A>). To use dynamic
column generation, the user must supply a subroutine which generates
the column corresponding to a particular user index, given the list of
active constraints in the current relaxation. When column generation
occurs, each column not currently active that has not been previously
fixed by reduced cost is either priced out immediately, or becomes
active in the current relaxation. Only a specified number of columns
may enter the problem at a time, so when that limit is reached, column
generation ceases. For further discussion of column generation, see
Sect. <A HREF="node89.html#two-phase">4.4.3.3</A>, where the two-phase algorithm is described.

<P>
Since the matrix is stored in compressed form, considerable
computation may be needed to add and remove rows and columns. Hence,
rows and columns are only physically removed from the problem when
there are sufficiently many to make it &ldquo;worthwhile.&rdquo; Otherwise,
deleted rows and columns remain in the matrix but are simply ignored
by the computation. Note that because ineffective rows left in the
matrix increase the size of the basis unnecessarily, it is usually
advisable to adopt an aggressive strategy for row removal.
