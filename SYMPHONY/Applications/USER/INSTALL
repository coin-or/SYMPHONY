SYMPHONY USER-5.1 APPLICATION INSTALLATION
==========================================

*******************************************************************************
*             COMPILING THE SYMPHONY USER APPLICATION (Unix)                 *
*******************************************************************************

Although USER application is designed to work stand alone, it requires to be  
configured with SYMPHONY. Therefore, you have to get this application 
within SYMPHONY package and follow the configuration steps of SYMPHONY.   

1. You can obtain the SYMPHONY source code either via the subversion 
repository or in the form of daily tarballs. 

The recommended method is to use subversion because it makes it easier to 
obtain updates. In a Unix-like environment (such as Linux or CYGWIN), 
the following command may be used to obtain SYMPHONY from 
source using SVN in most cases:

   svn checkout https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/SYMPHONY/trunk/ COIN-SYMPHONY

The alternative way is to get a daily snapshot of the source code as a tarball 
from  the download page of COIN-OR:

   http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/

2. If the code is obtained as a tarball, unpack the distribution with 
"tar -xzf SYMPHONY_XXX.tgz" where XXX is the date the snapshot is taken. 
This will create a subdirectory called SYMPHONY_XXX containing the 
distribution.

3. In order to compile SYMPHONY's applications, you must first compile the 
application specific library. Type

   cd 
   cd COIN-SYMPHONY
   ./configure --with-applications
   make
   make install

This will create the the Makefile of USER application together with 
SYMPHONY's application library called 'libSymAppl' to be used while 
building USER. Note that, sequential version library and the 
executable of SYMPHON will also be made and installed. 

4. Now you are free to move the application directory to wherever you want. 
Go to USER directory, (go to SYMPHONY/Applications/USER, if the package 
was not moved) and modify the variables in the Makefile if you want to add
your own defines, source and library files. Then, type    

   make

The executable "user" should be successfully made here. 

4. Test USER, using the sample file called sample.user included
with the distribution. To specify the file name, use the "-F" command-line
option, i.e., type

   user -F sample.user 

COMPILING FOR DISTRIBUTED NETWORKS
==================================

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE DISTRIBUTED MEMORY PARALLEL VERSION HAS NOT BEEN TESTED
IN VERSION 5.0 AND MAY BE BROKEN. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT TO USE IT AND
I WILL GET IT WORKING.

1. If you wish to compile a distributed version of the code, obtain and
install PVM from http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/.

2. Type, 

   cd 
   cd COIN-SYMPHONY
   ./configure --with-applications --with-pvm
   make
   make install

This will create the the Makefile of USER application together with 
SYMPHONY's parallel version application libraries to be used while 
building USER. Note that, sequential version library and the 
executable of SYMPHON will also be made and installed. 
Be sure that, you have PVM installed either in system path or PVM_ROOT
set as a bash environment variable. By default, configuration will assume
the following module dependencies: '--with-cg=yes --with-cp=yes --with-lp=no 
--with-tm=yes' (see the user manual or the file 'share/config.site' for more 
information). If you configure with

   ./configure --with-applications --with-pvm --with-lp=yes

then you will end up with the sequential version. Therefore, if you want 
to override the default set up, you must configure without one or more of 
module dependencies. 

3. Now you are free to move the application directory to wherever you want. 
Go to USER directory, (go to SYMPHONY/Applications/USER, if the package 
was not moved) and modify the variables in the Makefile if you want to add
your own defines, source and library files. Then, type    

   make

The executable "user_m$(EXT)", where $(EXT) is an extension to be added 
according to the chosen module dependencies, should be successfully made here. 

4. Make sure there are links from your '$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH/' subdirectory 
to each of the executables in your 'bin/' directory. This is required by PVM.

5. Start the PVM daemon by typing "pvm" on the command line and then typing
"quit".

6. Test USER, using the sample file called sample.user included
with the distribution. To specify the file name, use the "-F" command-line
option, i.e., type 

   user_m$(EXT) -F sample.user 

*******************************************************************************
*            COMPILING THE SYMPHONY USER APPLICATION (Windows)                *
*******************************************************************************

Here is a sketch outline of how to compile the SYMPHONY USER
application in Microsoft Windows. For information on developing your own
applications, please see the quick start guide below or the detailed
explanation in the user's manual. Direct support is provided for compilation
under MS Visual Studio 6.0. Compilation for other compilers should also be
possible. Note that the Windows version has some limitations. Detailed timing
information is not currently provided.  Support is only provided for running
in sequential mode at this time.

First, download SYMPHONY and unpack the archive if it is required. 
You now have three options. You can either compile on the command-line using 
automated MSDEV build system or NMAKE utility or you can use the provided 
projects and workspaces. Note that, in Windows, it is not recommended to 
move USER package from the SYMPHONY package. Otherwise, the user has 
to redefine all the paths to SYMPHONY and COIN header files as well as 
the paths to COIN project files. For all of the following options, first 
go to the SYMPHONY/Appliacations/USER/Win32/v6 directory. 

************************ Using MSDEV Utility *********************************

1. Open a command line terminal and type

   msdev user.dsw /make all    

This will create both the debug and release versions of SYMPHONY. If you 
want to compile only one of them, type 
 
   msdev user.dsw /make "all - debug" 

or 

   msdev user.dsw /make "all - release" 

For each command, the executable 'user.exe' will be created in 'Debug' 
and/or 'Release' directories.

2. To test the executable, type 

   Debug/user.exe -F ..\..\sample.user

3. If USER is modified, type 

   msdev user.dsw /make all /rebuild

in order to clean and rebuild everything. 

******************** Using the NMAKE Utility *********************************

1. Edit the file Win32\v6\user.mak to reflect your environment. This involves 
specifying the LP solver to be used and various paths. Only minor edits should 
be required. An explanation of what has to be set is contained in the comments 
in the makefile.  Note that, you have to first create the COIN libraries
Cgl, Clp, Osi, OsiClp and CoinUtils which reside in Win32 directory of the 
root directory of SYMPHONY package.

2. Once configuration is done, open a command line terminal and type

   nmake /f user.mak

   The executable "user.exe" will be created in the Debug directory.

3. To test the executable, type 

   user.exe -F ..\..\sample.user

******************** Using the MSVC++ Workspace ******************************

1. Open the workspace 'user.dsw'. 

2. Note that there are a number of additional preprocessor definitions that
control the functionality of SYMPHONY. These definitions are described in
"user.mak", a Unix-style makefile included in the distribution. To 
enable the functionality associated with a particular definition, simply add 
it to the list of definitions of "libSymphony" project together with the 
required libraries and paths. For instance, if you 
want to enable GMPL reader option, you need to

  - add the directory of the header files of GLPK to the include files path
  - add USE_GLPMPL to the defines
  - add the GLPK library to the workspace

2.  Make sure that the project 'user' is set as the active project from the 
Project/Set Active menu. Choose "Build user.exe" from the Build menu. This 
should successfully build the USER executable. 

3. To test the executable, right click on the user project, go to the
"Debug" tab and set the program arguments to "-F ..\..\sample.user". 
Note that command-line switches are Unix-style. 

4. Now choose "Execute" from the build menu and the solver should solve the
sample problem.

Note that there is some functionality missing from the Windows version. Most
prominently, the timing functions do not work. This functionality should be
easy to add -- let me know if you are interested in doing it and I will give
you all the help I can. In addition, the Windows version will only run in
sequential mode for a variety of reasons. However, it should be relatively
easy to get it running in parallel if you can get PVM working under
Windows. Let me know if you are interested. Finally, only CLP LP solver 
is maintained in current release. If you need to work with any other 
LP solver; although support for other LP solvers will be added later, I can 
send you simple instructions for configuring SYMPHONY's Windows version 
with other LP solvers.
