 1 dynamic cut generation (M)
   1.1 add parameters for different cuts
   1.2 add mir, twomir
 2 cut selection (A)
   2.1 use tightLower, tightUpper to get tighter bounds on variables from
       cglprobing

   4.1 octane (M)
   4.2 everything else (A)
 5 Branching
   5.1 reliability (A)
   5.2 hotstart (A) D
 6 Node selection (A)
 7 R.C. fixing (including root stuff) (A)
   7.1 carry rc fixing to child nodes (A)
   7.2 make loops for calculating tm->lb more efficient (A)
   7.3 print correct lb in print_tm_status (A)

16 diving (A)
17 tail off (A)
18 priority lists (M)
19 memory overflow (A)
20 why are we 15x slower than cplex in branch and bound (A)
21 use column cuts from cgl. tie it up with (7.1).
22 check_row_effectiveness() sometimes does not delete constraints. it just
   makes rhs very big. causes problems with flowcover cuts.
23 replace array as data-structure for heap with linked lists.
