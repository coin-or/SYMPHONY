*                  MODELLING WITH SYMPHONY USING FLOPC++                     * 
******************************************************************************
This application is intended to illustrate of how to use SYMPHONY OSI/C++ 
Interface with FLOPC++ algebraic modelling language. For further details, 
please see OSI related COIN documentations (www.coin-or.org), FLOPC++ 
tutorials (http://www.mat.ua.pt/thh/flopc) and the SYMPHONY-5.0 manual.

******************************************************************************
This version of the instance is intended to work with SYMPHONY-5.0. First, 
configure and compile COIN, SYMPHONY 5.0 (as described in SYMPHONY-5.0/README),
SYMPHONY OSI (located in COIN/Osi/OsiSym) and FLOPC++. Modify the variables in 
the FLOPC++/Makefile appropriately. In particular, you must set the path to 
SYMPHONY, FLOPC++, COIN and the LP solver which was used to build the 
SYMPHONY callable library. By default, note that, it is set to use CLP as the 
LP solver. Typing "make" in the FLOPC++ subdirectory should successfully make 
the executable "tap". To test the executable, simply type "./tap".

AUTHORS 

The Makefile and the tap.cpp sample file were taken from FLOPC++ repository 
and modified to use SYMPHONY OSI interface. Please see the FLOPC++ web site for
the details of this problem.
