BUILDING AND INSTALLING SYMPHONY Version 5.1.4
==============================================

The following are brief instructions that should be sufficient to install
SYMPHONY with default configuration settings in most cases. For more detailed
installation instructions and for more information on custom configurations,
please see the SYMPHONY user's manual, which can be downloaded from

https://projects.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY

******************************************************************************
* Building SYMPHONY in Unix-like environments (UNIX/LINUX/CYGWIN/MINGW/OSX)  *
******************************************************************************

SYMPHONY now uses the COIN-OR build system and the GNU autotools to automate
the build process. The build process should therefore be identical in all
Unix-like environments. These instructions will lead you through the steps
required to compile SYMPHONY as a generic MILP solver. This process will
create (1) a generic callable library that allows SYMPHONY to be called from
an application and (2) an executable that can be used as a stand-alone
application to solve MILPs written in either MPS or GMPL file format. SYMPHONY
can be further customized by implementing one of more than 50 callback
functions that change SYMPHONY's default execution of its algorithm. For
information on customizing SYMPHONY using callbacks, a quick start guide is
provided below.

DOWNLOADING
===========

You can obtain the SYMPHONY source code either via the subversion repository
or in the form of archived release. The recommended method in Unix is to use
subversion because it makes it easier to obtain updates. In a Unix-like
environment (such as Linux or CYGWIN), the following command may be used to
obtain SYMPHONY from source using SVN in most cases:

  svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/SYMPHONY/stable/5.1 SYMPHONY-5.1

Alternatively, you can download release versions of the source code 
from  the download page of COIN-OR:

  http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/SYMPHONY

If the code is obtained as a tarball, unpack the distribution with "tar -xzf
SYMPHONY-XX.tgz" where XX is the version number. This will
create a subdirectory called SYMPHONY-XX containing the distribution.

CONFIGURING
===========

The first step is to run a configuration script that will allow the
compilation process to be customized for your environment. to perform this
step, switch into the root directory of the distribution and type

  ./configure 

This will set up the default configuration files. If you want to override the
default settings, you can either run the configuration script with
command-line options or else modify the options in the file
'share/config.site'. For instance, you might want to specify the LP solver to
be used (Clp is the default). A list of options together with brief
explanations can be seen both in the file 'share/config.site' and by typing

   ./configure --help=recursive 

In order to enable or disable an option, either update the file 
'share/config.site' or add the option as an argument to configuration script. 
As an instance for the second case, running 

  ./configure --enable-debug

will set the configuration to compile the source files with debugging
flag. 

In order to read GMPL files, you need to have the GLPK package and SYMPHONY
has to be configured with

  ./configure --with-gmpl --with-glpk-lib="-L/usr/lib -lglpk" 
              --with-glpk-incdir=/usr/include 

assuming that the GLPK library and header files are located in 
/usr/lib and /usr/include directories. 

It is possible to use compilers oter than the default (which is g++). For
example, to perform at automated build of SYMPHONY using the MSVC++ compiler
'cl' with GNU autotools in the CYGWIN environment configure with

 ./configure CC=cl CXX=cl LD=link

BUILDING
========

1. After configuring, the code can be built by typing the commands

  make
  make install

This will first create the required libraries and binaries and then will 
install SYMPHONY. By default, the library 'libSym' and the executable 
'symphony' will be installed to the 'lib/' and 'bin/' directories. 

2. The SYMPHONY library, together with the header files in the subdirectory
'include/', can then be used to call SYMPHONY from any C/C++ code. The API for
this is described in the user's manual. The executable can also be used for
solving generic MILP problems in MPS or GMPL format. In order to read GMPL
files, you need to have the GLPK package and SYMPHONY has to be configured
with

  ./configure --with-gmpl --with-glpk-lib[=GLPK library] 
              --with-glpk-incdir[=GLPK include dir] 


For more pwerful modeling interface, FlopC++ can also be used to obtain a
capability similar to ILOG's Concert technology for building math programming
models (see SYMPHONY/Examples/FLOPC++). 

If you are planning to use the interactive optimizer, it is recommended to run
the configuration script with

  ./configure --enable-gnu-packages 

This will allow the interactive shell to be able to behave exactly like 
a Linux terminal command line, i.e., it will keep the history of the used 
commands, will complete the input word to possible commands, etc. Make sure
that you have the needed package (readline.h and history.h include files 
and their libraries) on the system files path.

3. To test SYMPHONY after building, type

  make test

to execute an automated unit test. To test out the optimizer manually. a
sample MPS file called "sample.mps" and a sample GMPL/AMPL file called
"sample.mod" together with its data file "sample.dat" are included with the
distribution. You can use either the command-line or the interactive
optimizer. To solve the sample MPS model, type 

  bin/symphony -F SYMPHONY/Datasets/sample.mps

To solve the GMPL model, use the "-F" switch to specify the file
name and the "-D" for the data file name if the input is in GMPL/AMPL format,
i.e., type

  bin/symphony -F SYMPHONY/Datasets/sample.mod -D SYMPHONY/Datasets/sample.dat

For more MPS data files for further testing, see the MIPLIB library in the
Data/ subdirectory. To run the interactive optimizer, execute SYMPHONY without
any command-line arguments, i.e., type

   bin/symphony 

and then type "help" or "?" to see a list of available commands.


4. After the SYMPHONY library and the executable are compiled and tested, you
can type

  make clean 

if you want to save disk space. 

5. That's it! Now you are ready to use SYMPHONY callable library or 
solve generic MILP problems through the executable.

SHARED MEMORY BUILD
===================

1. To compile a shared memory version of SYMPHONY, simply use an OpenMP
compliant compiler. Version 5.1.4 has been tested with gcc 4.2, and should work
by configuring with

  ./configure --with-openmp

2. Follow the instructions above for building and testing.

3. To invoke SYMPHONY from the command-line with multiple threads, specify the
number of threads with the '-p' option, i.e.,

  bin/symphony -p 2 -F SYMPHONY/Datasets/sample.mps

DISTRIBUTED MEMORY BUILD
========================

1. If you wish to compile a distributed version of the code, first make sure
you have PVM installed. You can obtain it from http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/.

2. To configure for a parallel build, invoke the configuration script as
follows:

  ./configure --with-pvm

Be sure that PVM is installed either in system path or that you have the
environment variable PVM_ROOT set properly. Note that there are a number of
different parallel configurations. The default configuration is to build two
parallel modules. The first one consists of the master, tree management, and
cut management modules, while the second one consists of the node processing,
and cut generation modules. For other configuration options, see the
share/config.site file.

3. Follow the build instructions above to build the code. Note that this will
also compile the sequential version.

4. Make sure there are links from your '$HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH/'
subdirectory to each of the executables in your 'bin/' directory. This is
required by PVM.

5. Start the PVM daemon by typing "pvm" on the command line and then typing
"quit".

6. As above, test SYMPHONY using the sample MPS file called sample.mps included
with the distribution. To specify the file name, use the "-F" command-line
option, i.e., in the root directory, type 

   bin/symphony_m$(EXT) -F SYMPHONY/Datasets/sample.mps 

where $(EXT) is an extension to be added according to the chosen module 
dependencies. To obtain more MPS data files for further
testing, download the MIPLIB library.

BUILDING APPLICATIONS
=====================

1. In order to compile SYMPHONY's applications, you must first compile the 
application-specific library with

  ./configure --with-application
   make 
   make install

This will create the application library called 'libSymAppl' to be used while
building custom applications. Note that the sequential version library and
executable will also be made and installed.

2. After building the library, go to one of the application subdirectories in
the SYMPHONY/Applications/ directory and type 'make' there. For more
information, including the parallel configuration instructions, see the
INSTALL file of the corresponding application.

******************************************************************************
*      COMPILING The SYMPHONY Library and Executable (Microsoft Windows)     *
******************************************************************************

Here is a sketch outline of how to compile SYMPHONY in Microsoft Windows.
These instructions will lead you through the steps required to compile
SYMPHONY as a generic MILP solver. This process will create (1) a generic
callable library that allows SYMPHONY to be called from an application and (2)
an executable that can be used as a stand-alone application to solve MILPs
written in either MPS or GMPL file format. SYMPHONY can be further customized
by implementing one of more than 50 callback functions that change SYMPHONY's
default execution of its algorithm. For information on customizing SYMPHONY
using callbacks, a quick start guide is provided below. Note that the Windows
version has some limitations. Detailed timing information is not currently
provided. Support is only provided for running in sequential mode at this
time.

First, obtain the source code by downloading from
\url{https://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/SYMPHONY/}. Unpack the archive to create
the directory \code{SYMPHONY-\VER\bs}. You now have three options.
You can either build using the MSVC++ IDE, build on the
command-line with MSVC++ executable, or use the NMAKE utility. 

******************** Building With the MSVC++ IDE ****************************

These instructions are for MSVC++ Version 8. Instructions for other versions
should be similar.

1. Go to 'Win32/v8' directory and open the solution file 'symphony.sln'. 

2. Note that there are a number of additional preprocessor definitions that
control the functionality of SYMPHONY. These definitions are described in
"sym.mak", a Unix-style makefile included in the distribution. To 
enable the functionality associated with a particular definition, simply add 
it to the list of definitions of "libSymphony" project together with the 
required libraries and paths. For instance, if you 
want to enable GMPL reader option, you need to

  - add the directory of the header files of GLPK to the include files path
  - add USE_GLPMPL to the defines
  - add the GLPK library to the workspace

2. Make sure that the project 'symphony' is set as the startup project by
choosing "Set as Startup Project" from the Project menu after selecting the
symphony project in the Solution Explorer. Choose "Build Solution" from the
Build menu. This should successfully build the SYMPHONY library and the
corresponding executable.

3. To test the executable, go to the "Debug" tab and choose "Start Without
Debugging." and then type "help" or "?" to see a list of available commands.

Note that there is some functionality missing from the Windows version. Most
prominently, the timing functions do not work. In addition, the Windows
version will only run in sequential mode for a variety of reasons. However, it
should be relatively easy to get it running in parallel if you can get PVM
working under Windows. Let me know if you are interested. Finally, only CLP LP
solver is maintained in current release. If you need to work with any other LP
solver; although support for other LP solvers will be added later, I can send
you simple instructions for configuring SYMPHONY's Windows version with other
LP solvers.

***************** Building in a Windows Terminal ***************************

These instructions are for MSVC++ Version 8. Instructions for other versions
should be similar.

1. Open a command line terminal. Go to 'Win32/v6' directory and type 

   devenv symphony.sln /build all    

This will create both the debug and release versions of SYMPHONY. If you 
want to compile only one of them, type 
 
   devenv symphony.sln /build "all - debug" 

or 

   devenv symphony.sln /build "all - release" 

For each command, the library 'libSymphony.lib' and the executable 
'symphony' will be created in 'Debug' and/or 'Release' directories.  The 
library, together with the header files in 'SYMPHONY\include\', can then be 
used to call SYMPHONY from any C/C++ code. The API for calling SYMPHONY is 
described in the user's manual.

2. To test the executable, type 

   Debug/symphony.exe -F ..\..\SYMPHONY\Datasets\sample.mps

If you want to use the interactive optimizer, simply type  

   Debug/symphony.exe

and then type "help" or "?" to see a list of available commands.
 

3. If SYMPHONY is modified, type 

   devenv symphony.sln /rebuild all 

in order to clean and rebuild everything. 

*************** Building With the MSVC++ compiler in CYGWIN *******************

It is possible to perform at automated build of SYMPHONY using the MSVC++
compiler 'cl' with GNU autotools in the CYGWIN environment. To do so, follow
the instuctions for building in Unix-like environments, except when
configuring, use the command

 ./configure CC=cl CXX=cl LD=link

******************** Building With the NMAKE Utility **************************

1.  Go to 'Win32' directory and edit the 'sym.mak' makefile to reflect 
your environment. This involves specifying the LP solver to be used, 
assigning some variables and  setting various paths. Only minor edits 
should be required. An explanation of what has to be set is contained in the 
comments in the makefile.  Note that, you have to first create the COIN 
libraries Cgl, Clp, Osi, OsiClp and CoinUtils which reside in Win32/v8 
directory.

2. Once configuration is done, open a command line terminal and type 

   nmake sym.mak

This will make the SYMPHONY library 'libSymphony.lib' and the executable 
'symphony' in 'Debug' directory. The library, together with the header files 
in 'SYMPHONY\include\', can then be used to call SYMPHONY from any C/C++ code. 
The API for calling SYMPHONY is described in the user's manual.

3. To test the executable, type 

   Debug\symphony.exe -F ..\..\SYMPHONY\Datasets\sample.mps

If you want to use the interactive optimizer, simply type  

   Debug\symphony.exe 

and then type "help" or "?" to see a list of available commands.
