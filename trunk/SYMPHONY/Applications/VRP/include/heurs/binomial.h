| degree of that node in the tree, the parent field points to the parent |
| node, the child field points to the left-most child of the node, and   |
| the sibling field points to the right sibling. The other field contain |

| its value while node1 and node2 denote the nodes between which it can  |
| be inserted in order to obtain that savings number.                    |
