*                         SYMPHONY Examples                                  * 
******************************************************************************

These examples are intended to illustrate the usage of SYMPHONY as a callable
library and are taken from the mini-tutorial on the SYMPHONY Callable Library 
for MILP which can be found here: 

http://www.lehigh.edu/~tkr2/research/talks/SYMPHONY-TUTORIAL-ICS05.pdf

Current examples repository includes: 

milp         : implementation of a basic MILP solver
milp2        : implementation of a basic MILP solver with a user defined input
warm_start1  : usage of warm starting capability on parameter modification
warm_start2  : usage of warm starting capability on problem modification
warm_start3  : usage of warm starting that the problem stops every ten
               seconds and prints out the current status before starting to 
               resolve again.
bicriteria   : implementation of SYMPHONY's ability to solve bicriteria 
               optimization problems
sensitivity  : usage of basic sensitivity analysis features

First, configure and compile SYMPHONY as described in SYMPHONY/README. Modify
the variables in the Examples/Makefile appropriately. In particular, you must
set the path to SYMPHONY and COIN root directories and LP solver header 
and library files directories. Typing "make" should successfully make the 
executables. If you need to install a specific example only, add the name of 
that example as a make command line argument, i.e., for instance, type 
"make milp".
