<h3> Interactive Graph Drawing IGD-1.0 </h3>
IGD is a library of Tcl/Tk functions for displaying, manipulating,
scaling and printing undirected graphs. The primary goal of this
application is to provide an easy-to-use visualization tool that is
flexible enough for a wide range of situations, like debugging and
displaying results of graph algorithms, or creating postscript
pictures of graphs. This package does NOT contain graph layout
algorithms. The idea of how to move around the nodes on the canvas 
is borrowed from John Ousterhout's book, Tcl and the Tk Toolkit.
<p>
IGD is implemented using Tcl version 7.5p1+ and Tk version 4.1p1+dash
(that is Tcl 7.5p1 with the plus patch and Tk 4.1p1 with the plus and
dash patches). It is very likely to work with Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2. 
(If you don't have Tcl/Tk or the patches installed on your system, take a 
look at the 
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/Technology/tcl/Tcl.html">Tcl WWW Info page</A> 
to see where you can find it, etc.) 
<p>
The library can be used in two ways: 
<ul>
   <li> The functions can be sourced into wish and then directly invoked. 
        The library was implemented for this purpose (we use IGD for 
        displaying graphs while running a complex application).
   <li> As soon as one application window is displayed (and this can be
        done with the short script called igd.tcl) the user can directly
        manipulate the windows and graphs via menus, buttons and mouse
        clicks (which are all linked to functions in the library); hence
        the adjective interactive. This way IGD can be used as a stand-alone 
        application. For details see <detailed_desc.txt>. Some example graphs 
        are included with the source code (those that have .g extension).
</ul>

Implementation of an interface that links other applications with IGD is
on the way, it will be available soon.
