<h3> Interactive Graph Drawing IGD-1.0 </h3>
IGD is a library of Tcl/Tk functions for displaying, manipulating,
scaling and printing undirected graphs. The primary goal of this
application is to provide an easy-to-use visualization tool that is
flexible enough for a wide range of situations, like debugging and
displaying results of graph algorithms, or creating postscript
pictures of graphs. This package does NOT contain graph layout
algorithms. The idea of how to move around the nodes on the canvas 
is borrowed from John Ousterhout's book, Tcl and the Tk Toolkit.
<p>
IGD is implemented using Tcl version 7.5p1+ and Tk version 4.1p1+dash
(that is Tcl 7.5p1 with the plus patch and Tk 4.1p1 with the plus and
dash patches). It is very likely to work with Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2. 
(If you don't have Tcl/Tk or the patches installed on your system, take a 
look at the 
<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/Technology/tcl/Tcl.html">Tcl WWW Info page</A> 
to see where you can find it, etc.) 
<p>
The library can be used in two ways: 
<ul>
   <li> The functions can be sourced into wish and then directly invoked. 
        The library was implemented for this purpose (we use IGD for 
        displaying graphs while running a complex application).
   <li> As soon as one application window is displayed (and this can be
        done with the short script called igd.tcl) the user can directly
        manipulate the windows and graphs via menus, buttons and mouse
        clicks (which are all linked to functions in the library); hence
        the adjective interactive. This way IGD can be used as a stand-alone 
        application, and the user does not have to know details about
        the library functions. 
</ul>

This documentation intends to describe the second way. The library functions 
(along with the global variables) are fully documented in .......ps.
<p>
Implementation of an interface that links other applications with IGD is
on the way, it will be available soon.

<h4> Description </h4>
The basic units of this application are windows. These windows contain
a canvas on which (undirected) graphs are displayed, menus, buttons,
etc. Defaults for some window and graph properties (i.e., how and what
is displayed) are associated with each window. A window gets
these default values from the default list for the entire application
when the window is created. Default values corresponding to one
particular window can be changed through menu options, but those
corresponding to the entire application can be changed only by editing
the procedure Igd_StartUp. (Sorry about this, but as mentioned
above we mainly use the library directly; in that case the application
defaults can be simply set with a function call.)
<p>
The following is a list of window properties with a short explanation;
their values can be set from the Window menu. All values must be 
nonnegative integers unless specified otherwise.
<ul>
   <li> canvas_width and canvas_height are the width and the height 
        (in pixels) of the canvas (on which graphs are displayed). 
        Can be changed through the Resize canvas menu option.  
   <li> viewable_width and viewable_height are the width and height of the 
        display window. The canvas can be bigger than the display window,
        the scrollbar can be used to move the desired part of the canvas into
        the display window. Can be changed through the Resize viewable window 
        menu option, or by any option your window manager provides to resize a 
        window.  
   <li> disp_nodelabels, disp_nodeweights and disp_egdeweights are binary
        values indicating whether to display labels and weights of nodes and
        weights of edges (see more details later). Can be changed by clicking 
        on the radio buttons under the canvas.
   <li> node_dash and edge_dash are patterns that determine the outline of 
        nodes and edges. A dash pattern is a sequence of nonnegative integers
        indicating the lengths of line segments and gaps in the outline. 
        E.g., {3 3} will produce a dashed line with line segments and gaps 
        both 3 pixels long. The empty pattern produces a solid outline.
        Can be changed through the Default dash patterns menu option for 
        all the nodes or edges at once, or by the Modify node/edge options 
        in the Node and Edge menus.
   <li> node_radius is the radius of nodes in the graph. Can be changed 
        through the Default node radius option for all the nodes at once or
        by the Modify node option in the Node menu.
   <li> interactive_mode is a binary value indicating whether some mouse 
        actions are enabled or disabled (if the interactive mode is disabled
        nodes can be created, erased or moved only through the menus but not 
        with mouse actions as described later). Can be changed through the 
        Interactive mode menu option.
   <li> mouse_tracking is a binary value indicating whether the mouse tracking 
        option is enabled or not. The mouse tracker is a small rectangle in
        the bottom-right corner of the display window showing the current
        position of the mouse over the canvas. Can be changed through the 
        Mouse tracking menu option.
   <li> scale_factor indicates by how much the canvas has been rescaled, it
        need not be an integer. Scaling is done from the origin (top-left
        corner of the canvas); the size of the nodes is not changed, only 
        their relative positions. Can be changed through the (re)Scale
        graph menu option.
   <li> nodelabel_font, nodeweight_font and edgeweight_font are the fonts 
        used for node labels and weights and edge weights. The font names can
        be any standard X font name. Can be changed through the Default fonts
        menu option. 
</ul>
There are additional options not mentioned above in the Window menu:
new windows can be created using the Clone window or New window menu
options; windows can be erased (i.e, graphs deleted from the canvas)
by Erase window; individual windows can be destroyed by Quit from window.
<p>
Graphs displayed in the windows are undirected. Nodes are represented
with a circle (different nodes can have different radii and different
outlines), a label (a short text displayed within the circle) and an
optional weight (a short text displayed North-East from the
circle). Nodes can be created, modified, moved, raised, lowered and
deleted through the menu options in Node menu. There are shortcuts for
these actions; e.g, if the left mouse button is clicked twice over a
position, a new node will be displayed there. Edges are represented
with lines (different edges can have different outlines) with optional
weights (short texts placed East from the middle of the line). Edges
can be added, modified and deleted through menu options in Edge menu.
Also, nodes can be moved around by clicking on the middle mouse button
and dragging the node with the button pressed down; edges attached to a
node will move with the node.
<p>
To make the menu options easier to use, two registers have been added.
The first (second) register stores a position -- and a node if there
is one at that position -- if the left (right) mouse button is clicked
over that position. Whenever a menu option is chosen from the Node menu,
if there is a node in the first register, it will be proposed. Whenever 
a menu option is chosen from the Edge menu, if there are nodes in both 
of the registers they will be proposed as endpoints of the edge. The 
registers can be cleared with the 'clear register 1(2)' buttons.
<p>
The following mouse-keyboard actions can be used instead of some 
menu options:
<ul>
   <li> Add a new node: click twice on the left mouse button over the 
        desired position
   <li> Move a node: Click on the node with the middle mouse button and 
        drag the node with the button pressed down.
   <li> Delete a node: Click on the node with the left mouse button and 
        press 'd'.
   <li> Raise a node: Click on the node with the left mouse button and 
        press 'r'.
   <li> Lower a node: Click on the node with the left mouse button and 
        press 'l'.
   <li> Display information about a node: Click on the node with the left
        mouse button and press '?'.
   <li> Add an edge: Click on one of the endpoints with the left mouse button 
        and then click twice on the other endpoint with the right mouse
        button. Edges can be deleted only from the menu.
</ul>
Graphs can be loaded into windows from files using the Load from file
option in the File menu. See the input format below. Graphs can be
saved in this format with the Save to file menu option. Also, a
greyscale version of the graph in the display window can be saved in
PostScript format using the Save PostScript option (picture will be
rescaled/rotated if it doesn't fit an 8x11 paper as it is).
<p>
The format in which the graph is saved or can be loaded is the
following. See any of the files with .g extension that came with the
package as an example. Note that values containing spaces must be
enclosed in brackets {}. The data has to be in the order given below
with the exeption of comments that can be placed anywhere.
<blockquote>
<dl compact>
   <dt> c
   <dd> Empty lines or lines starting with a 'c' are skipped (comment).
   <dt> w 
   <dd> node_dash {2 2} <br>
        Window properties listed in lines starting with a w.
   <dt> p 
   <dd> nodenum edgenum <br>
        The number of nodes and edges in the graph.
   <dt> n
   <dd> node_id x y key [weight] [label] [dash] [radius] <br>
	Description of a node. Nodes are displayed in the order they
are listed. <br>
	node_id: identifier of node, must be unique <br>
        x, y: coordinates of the node <br>
        key: indicates (as a binary number) which of the following  
           data is given: weight, label, dash pattern, radius.
           e.g., if key = 11 = 8+2+1 then the weight, dash pattern, 
           and radius are listed after the key (in this order), but 
           not the label.
   <dt> a
   <dd> edge_id node_id_1 node_id_2 key [weight] [dash] <br>
        Description of an edge. Edges are displayed in the order they
are listed. <br>
	edge_id: identifier of the edge <br>
	node_id_1, node_id_2: node identifiers of the endpoints of the
edge <br>
	key: indicates (as a binary number) which of the following
           data is given: weight, dash pattern. To be consistent with
           notation at nodes, weight adds 8, dash pattern adds 2 to key.

<p>
A short decription of each menu option is provided in the Help menu. 
Help windows can be kept open during the application. 

<h4> How to use IGD </h4>
There is a short script included with the source code called igd.tcl.
Edit the first line of the script to have the correct path to wish on
your system there, then make the file executable and run it.  igd.tcl
will source the library and then it displays a window. Now using the
Load from file option in the File menu load one of the example graphs
(any file with extension .g). Experiment with the menu options and the
mouse-keyboard actions described above. Use the Help menu for a quick
reference.
